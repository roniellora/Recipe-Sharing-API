## About the API

This program functions as a Recipe Sharing Platform constructed with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It offers a RESTful API enabling users to create, view, modify, and remove recipes.

## Features

In the world of cooking, exchanging and uncovering fresh recipes is a crucial aspect of the journey. The Recipe Sharing API strives to streamline this interaction by offering developers a foundation to construct apps that empower users to effortlessly share, uncover, and delve into recipes.

1. **Managing Recipes**:
- **Creation**: Users can craft their own recipes, inputting details like ingredients and steps.
- **Retrieval**: Users can view recipes made by others, with full descriptions including title, ingredients, instructions, and ratings.
- **Updating**: Recipes are editable, allowing for adjustments and enhancements.
- **Delete**: Users can delete recipes from their collection.

2. **Exploring and Discovery**:
- **Name-Based Search**: Users can search for recipes by name, simplifying the process of finding a specific recipe.
- **Tag-Based Search**: Users can explore recipes by tags such as 'Lunch' or 'Breakfast', aiding in discovering recipes suited to specific categories.
- **ID-Based Search**: Recipes can be searched for using their unique identifier.

4. **Managing Users**:
- **Login**: Users can log in with existing credentials. If no account exists, a new one will be generated.
- **Sign-Up**: Users are able to register with a unique username and password combination.

5. **Handling Errors**: The application includes thorough error management. In case of an error, informative error messages will be displayed, along with a stack trace in development mode.

## Local Setup
Follow these steps to set up the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roniellora/Recipe-Sharing-API
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate into the cloned repository directory and install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Go to `index.js` file and change **mongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://admin:12345@api-sharing.wwdxcbn.mongodb.net/api-sharing?retryWrites=true&w=majority')** with your actual MONGODB connection.

4. **Start the Server**: Now, you can start the server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node . 
```

The server will start, and you should see a message like <span style="color:green"><strong>Server running on http://localhost:3000...</strong></span> in your terminal.

5. **Test the Application**: You can now test the application by sending requests to <span style="color:green"><strong>Listening on http://localhost:3000/recipe</strong></span>. You can use a tool like Postman to send HTTP requests.
